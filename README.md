# Tracker

An addiction tracker, with inspiration from "I am Sober"

---

# Currently Implemented Features

Currently the program only tracks your seconds since your
last relapse and how many times today you relapsed

---

# Future Development

I'm planning to add different features such as a GUI,
graphs, an undo feature, leaderboards, customizable
messages when "relapsing," and more in the future.
